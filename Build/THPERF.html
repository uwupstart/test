I am a returning student who has a career in Education and I run my own theatre company. I've returned to the program to improve my craft. I have learned a plethora of knowledge from the program thus far and look forward to continuing my journey."</h4> <h5 class="bq-bottom">Lynn Scott</h5> <h5 class="bq-bottom">Agnes in Bitter/Sweet Fools</h5> </div> <div class="offset-4 bq-r col-12"> <h4 class="bq-title">"Not only is my name in the word theatre, but it literally changed my life. As a child, I struggled with extreme anxiety, so much that I could not go upstairs by myself long after the average child. However, my drama experience taught me to challenge that fear and drew me into a world I now love. Because of theatre in homeschool and high school, I am able to do things I never dreamed of being able to do, such as being here in university. Theatre teaches you vital skills that you need for any life path: confidence, willingness to take risks, emotional intelligence, and so on. I am only in my first year, but I have already learned so much and felt so welcomed in the theatre community here at UW, and I know you will too. :)"</h4> <h5 class="bq-bottom">Thea Andres (they/them)</h5> <h5 class="bq-bottom">Tom in Bitter/Sweet Fools</h5> </div> <div class="bq col-12"> <h4 class="bq-title">"I am an exchange student here at the University of Waterloo from Australia. I must say that I have never experienced a theatre program quite like the one here in Waterloo and I am amazed by its professionalism and ability to encourage constant growth in each individual. Since I was young, I always knew that performing was my outlet and so I have done a lot of drama and music over the years. It always inspired me to see the world in new ways and I always felt that I could be myself whilst playing another person! I have turned my passion for theatre and performance into a teaching area alongside English and expect to become a high school teacher in 2022. So far, Waterloo has provided me with an extremely insightful and engaging experience that I will take with me into the classroom. "</h4> <h5 class="bq-bottom">Lilly McDonald</h5> <h5 class="bq-bottom">Elizabeth in Bitter/Sweet Fools.</h5> </div> <div class="offset-4 bq-r col-12"> <h4 class="bq-title">"I originally started university at a school in Toronto; I thought I needed to get away from the town I grew up in to grow as a person and as an artist. I ended up back at the University of Waterloo thinking I was settling for my second choice - I was wrong. This program challenges me in ways I didn’t expect, and I appreciate each semester more than the last. It has been a surprising and enriching experience to be taught acting techniques, technical skills, history, and more in order to become a well-rounded theatre practitioner. But by far, the dedication, patience, and wealth of experience that comes from the staff in this program while I have been learning new hands-on skills has proved itself to be the best asset to this program. "</h4> <h5 class="bq-bottom">Monica Durlak</h5> <h5 class="bq-bottom">Director of Bitter/Sweet Fools</h5> </div> <div class="bq col-12"> <h4 class="bq-title">"I came to UWaterloo with the hope of learning basic backstage knowledge. UWaterloo’s theatre program has given me such an immense amount of opportunities for so many aspects of theatre.

I soon discovered that the theatre program here is equally filled with amazing and talented artists that encourage and inspire everyone to do their best. I can get the skills I need in a supportive and enjoyable environment. "</h4> <h5 class="bq-bottom">Emma-Leigh Simonot</h5> <h5 class="bq-bottom">Alana in Things we Lost in the Aftermath</h5> </div> <div class="bq col-12"> <h4 class="bq-title">"When deciding which University to go to I went back and forth between programs in Toronto and the Theatre and Performance program at the University of Waterloo. I ultimately chose this program because of the Co-Op element that I have paired with my degree. I have gained both hands on experience in class and in the world outside of the classroom. With each semester I can feel myself growing as an artist and becoming a better person. This program is filled with wonderful students and instructors who genuinely care about making Theatre with meaning beyond simple entertainment."</h4> <h5 class="bq-bottom">Alexandra Kale</h5> <h5 class="bq-bottom">Wardrobe Crew Member</h5> </div> </div> </section> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="script.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></body></html>
