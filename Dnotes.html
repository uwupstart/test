          <h1>A Note on <i>UpStart 20</i> Play Development</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="col-12">Everything you experience in UpStart 20 was made by students and alumni. They conceived these projects, wrote them, directed them, designed them, produced them, publicized them, and are presenting them for you now. 
            After many years as a student-run, extra-curricular festival, UpStart was integrated into the Theatre and Performance curriculum in 2016. This is our third UpStart since then, and although faculty and staff now act as mentors at all stages of the production process, the opportunity for generations of students to challenge and support one another is still what matters most. 
            This year, the UpStart cycle began with a workshop for aspiring playwrights in early fall 2019. Students pitched their projects in October, and the selected plays received another writing workshop in late fall. This term began with a month of intensive development: each play was substantially rewritten at least three times, while directors evolved their conceptual approaches, designers sketched the worlds of the plays, and dramaturgs planned their audience outreach strategies. Four weeks of rehearsal and production followedâ€”a very short time to bring work with such high production values to the stage. 
            The results are, as always with UpStart, even more wonderful than last time. 
            The Theatre and Performance program is honoured to present UpStart 20.
